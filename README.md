# UTMIST Developer Guide (2020-2021)

Welcome to being a developer at UTMIST!

## Projects

As a developer in either the [Academics](https://utmist.gitlab.io/team/academics) and/or [Engineering](https://utmist.gitlab.io/team/engineering) Departments, you'll work on a machine intelligence, data science, or statistical project in a team. We treat these as collaborative learning and portfolio opportunities, and want developers to accomplish something they can be proud of.

We have three types of projects:

- [Academic](https://utmist.gitlab.io/team/academics): Paper reproduction or extension or other academic/research work.
  - Academic projects almost always involve paper reading (and maybe even writing), so strong academic performance and technical knowledge are considered vital.
- Applied ([Engineering](https://utmist.gitlab.io/team/engineering)): Open-ended, similar to "side projects" or hackathon projects.
  - Most of these (if not all) should be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/utmist). You will need to create an account.
- Infrastructure ([Engineering](https://utmist.gitlab.io/team/engineering)): Tools and services that help UTMIST function at its core.
  - These (including this document) are hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/utmist) and mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/utmist).
  - You will need to create an account on GitLab, preferably with the same username as your GitHub account.

##### Notes on Projects and Teams

- Projects and codebases should generally be open-source. This is not a strict rule but a preference.
- Teams should have a minimum of two (2) members; three (3) or more is highly recommended.
- If we originally offered you a position in both departments, the one you'll ultimately be a part of will depend on the project you join.
- If for any reason you would like to switch your department to work on the other type of project, we're happy to discuss that with you and help you fit in.

### Starting a Project

Some developers will have their own ideas, and we want to provide leadership opportunities as well. Feel free to submit a proposal (link to be included soon), including an abstract and team/resource expectations. If we accept your proposal after discussing it with you, you will serve as the Director, and we'll help you with your team-forming process.

**(Update 2020/07/19) during the remainder of July, try to be active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/88mSPw8) (#academics, #engineering) to chat with other developers. This will help you identify similar interests and discuss ideas before you submit. A good conversation starter would be to [@mention](https://discordia.me/en/mentions) the developer role(s) to state your interests, and use the text or voice channels.**

#### Suggested Proposal Structure

Please submit your proposal in some common document format (PDF, Markdown, etc.). It will be fairly open-ended but we suggest one to two pages including the following points.

- Abstract (background, precedent, general motivations).
- List of resources (papers, articles, and advisors, as applicable).
- Summary of specific goals.
- Expectations for teammates (team size, expertise, availability, etc.) and advising.

**Please submit your proposal by 23:59 on August 7th, 2020 to [utorontomist@gmail.com](mailto:utorontomist@gmail.com).**

### Joining a Project

Most developers will join a team in **mid/late-August or September (starting August 15th).** You can [review the list of ongoing projects](https://utmist.gitlab.io/projects)† and follow the instructions for the project(s) you're interested in. The Director(s) will likely request to chat with you (like a **really informal** interview) in this team-forming process.‡

**There is no strict requirement that you are already an associate developer at UTMIST; you can simply reach out to the Director of the project you're interested in to make possible arrangements.**

### Working on a Project

These projects are meant to be a collaborative learning experience. While the Director will lead the discourse and groupwork, every member of the team should be involved in decision-making. In addition to the expected project work, each team is also responsible for

- Clarifying the scope and context of the project;
- Setting the timeline, goals, and team expectations (such as commitment, meetings, self-learning);
- Communicating progress, effort, issues, and concerns to each other and their VP; and
- Preparing a final presentation in some form, such as a talk, video, infographic, technical article, or documented codebase.

#### Communication

- You should follow either _#academics_ or _#engineering_ (whichever is applicable) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/88mSPw8) and use them to discuss **notable updates** with your VP and department.
- Bug fixing, meeting arrangements and other team-level discussions can happen in any private medium the team agrees on. This could be a Discord, Weixin (WeChat), or Facebook Messenger group chat, or something else.

#### Documentation

It's important to have not just good ideas and working code but also documentation. For whatever is applicable to you, ensure you write

- Descriptive annotations and commentary;
- Complete package and internal documentation; and/or
- Meaningful but concise commit messages.

#### Presentation

For most, if not all projects, we would like to see a final presentation of some form, to be ready near the end of the school year in March\*. This could be a talk, video, infographic, technical article, or documented codebase. Teams can also present work-in-progress (WIP) material or interesting milestones or resources at earlier times if appropriate.

We're glad to have you join us, and hope you have a good experience. If you have any questions or concerns, let us know in the _#academics_ and/or _#engineering_ channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/88mSPw8).

###### \* - The timeline is currently approximated; this document along with our Discord channels will be updated when specific dates are determined.

###### † - Academic and applied projects will be listed after proposals are reviewed; this document along with our Discord channels will be updated then.

###### ‡ - Project Directors will understand that most developers enter a project with plenty of room for learning and growth. With that said, in the off chance that UTMIST selected you as a developer but you couldn't join or weren't interested in any listed projects, UTMIST will help you find work on something meaningful. Please feel free to discuss this with us.
